### Overview

This is the second post in a three-part series that shows you how to install 
and configure a serverless web app on AWS using AWS Amplify and AppSync 
for the backend and Create React App for the frontend.

### Add API and Database:

Add a GraphQL API to your app and automatically provision 
a database with the following command (accepting all defaults is OK):

```shell
$ amplify add api
```

This command will run you through the creation of the AWS AppSync GraphQL API.

```shell
? Please select from one of the below services: GraphQL
? Provide API name: mygreatapp
? Choose an authorization type for the API: AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS
? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema?: N
? Do you want a guided schema creation? Y
? What best describes your project? One-to-many relationship
? Do you want to edit the schema now? Y
```

This will open a graphQL Schema in your editor.

Since this tutorial is meant to help you with a simple setup, 
we are not going to make any changes to our GraphQL schema for the time being.

After you have saved the file, head back to your terminal and press Enter to finish the setup.

This is what you should see after finishing the process:

```shell
GraphQL schema compiled successfully.

Edit your schema at /dev/amplify/backend/api/dev/schema.graphql 
or place .graphql files in a directory at /dev/amplify/backend/api/dev/schema

Successfully added resource dev locally
```
This means that our api is now setup in our computer, but what about the remote server?

All we need to do to set this up is run the following command:

```shell
$ amplify push
```
