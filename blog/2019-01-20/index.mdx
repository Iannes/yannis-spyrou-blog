### Overview

This is the first post in a three-part series that shows you how to install 
and configure a serverless web app on AWS using AWS Amplify and AppSync 
for the backend and Create React App for the frontend.

AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications.

AWS AppSync is a fully managed GraphQL service with real-time data synchronisation and offline programming features.  

In this first post, you will learn how to:

  - Install &amp; configure the Amplify CLI from your command line
  - initialise an Amplify project with a React app

### Prerequisites

- Mac or Win10 local development environment node version 10.x or greater

- `npm` version 5.x or greater (comes with npx) or `yarn`

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions to create the related resources

### Amplify CLI &amp; React app installation

To install AWS Amplify CLI run the below command:

```shell
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

Next step is scaffolding our React app.


```bash
$ npx create-react-app mygreatapp

$ cd mygreatapp

$ npm install -g @aws-amplify

```

We will also need to install React-specific Amplify UI components, by running the following command:

```shell
$ npm install aws-amplify-react
```

Next command is a one-time setup step.
Going forward on new projects, we won't have to configure this again. 

```shell
$ amplify configure
```

The amplify configure step helps you with the following:

- Signing up and signing in into AWS

- Setting up an IAM user with the appropriate policies for the CLI to deploy AWS resources on our behalf. 

- Creating an AWS Profile on your local system with reference to the accessKey and secretKey tied to the IAM user created in the above step. 

This AWS Profile could be given a custom name and can be used for initialising any number of projects moving forward. 

Essentially the AWS profile defines which AWS account and region the AWS resources would be deployed to.

Once we run `amplify configure`, the CLI will take us through the initial configuration.

```shell
- ? region: `<your-region-of-choice>`

- ? user name: `<your.email>@example.com`

- ? accessKeyId: `<'Access key ID' from credentials.csv>`

- ? secretAccessKey: `<'Secret access key' from credentials.csv>`
  
- ? Profile Name: `default` 
```

Before initialising our Amplify project,we need to make sure we are in the right directory in our React app.

In my case all I need to do is:

```shell
$ cd mygreatapp
```

Next we'll need to run the *amplify init* command.

This command will run you through the init process.
Go ahead and accept the defaults and use ‘dev’ or  `test` as environment name.

```shell
$ amplify init
```

We only need to run this once for each project to connect our app with an AWS backend. 

This setup helps us with the following:

- Selecting our AWS Profile which would be used to provision cloud resources for your app

- Selecting the frontend framework for our app and corresponding frontend framework related configurations (like the build command to build your frontend code). 

This information helps the CLI publish the app to the cloud (after executing the build command), as well as helping to run the app locally.

To verify that the CLI is set up for your React app, run the following command:

```shell
$ amplify status
```

If all went well, the Amplify CLI should output the following status table with no resources listed:

| Category | Resource Name | | Operation  | Provider Plugin |
| ---------| ------------- | | ---------- | --------------- |

That was it! If everything went well, you have successfully
initialised a cloud project using Amplify.

Stay tuned for the next part of this series that will take you through the provisioning of the remote servers.
