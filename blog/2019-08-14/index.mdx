### Overview

This is the third post in a three-part series that shows you how to install 
and configure a serverless web app on AWS using AWS Amplify and AppSync 
for the backend and Create React App for the frontend.

### Configuring your React app:

To connect to the new API, we first need to configure our React project with our Amplify project 
credentials. In your `src` folder there is a file called `aws-exports.js`.
This file holds all of the information our local project needs to know about our cloud resources.

As I mentioned in my previous post, this file should be added to a `.gitignore` file, so if you haven't done so already,
go ahead and run the following command:

```shell
$ echo "aws-exports.js" >> .gitignore
```

To configure the React app, open `src/app.js` &amp; add the following lines:

```js
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react';

import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

import { Rehydrated } from 'aws-appsync-react';

import config from 'aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(config);
```

The last line tells Amplify to use the `aws-exports.js` file to connect to the correct backend API.

You'll notice however that we have some imports that have to do with authentication.

```js
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react';
```
These are helper functions provided by Amplify so we can use the out-of-the-box solution that 
AWS provides us with for auth services.

After the `App` declaration, at the end of the file you should add the following lines:

```js
export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

To test if everything works as intended, you should run `yarn start` or `npm start` 
and see if you are presented with the default AWS login UI.

If this is the case, try and register as a new user. Aws should send an email to you so you can confirm your email address.
After that, you are going to be able to login and see the React app in all its glory!

You have now successfully connected to the API from your React app.

Stay tuned for the next part of this series that will take you through querying data from our React App using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
