### Overview

This is the second post in a three-part series that shows you how to install 
and configure a serverless web app on AWS using AWS Amplify and AppSync 
for the backend and Create React App for the frontend.

### Add AppSync API and DynamoDB Database:

Add a GraphQL API to your app and automatically provision 
a database with the following command (accepting all defaults is OK):

```shell
$ amplify add api
```

This command will run you through the creation of the AWS AppSync GraphQL API.

```shell
? Please select from one of the below services: GraphQL

? Provide API name: mygreatapp

? Choose an authorization type for the API: AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS

? Do you have an annotated GraphQL schema?: N

? Do you want a guided schema creation? Y

? What best describes your project? One-to-many relationship

? Do you want to edit the schema now? Y
```

This will open a graphQL Schema in your editor.

Since this tutorial is meant to help you with a simple setup, 
we are not going to make any changes to our GraphQL schema for the time being.
After you have saved the file, head back to your terminal and press Enter to finish the setup.

This is what you should see after finishing the process:

```shell
GraphQL schema compiled successfully.

Edit your schema at /dev/amplify/backend/api/dev/schema.graphql 

or place .graphql files in a directory at /dev/amplify/backend/api/dev/schema

Successfully added resource dev locally

```
Now a new folder, named `amplify` should have appeared at the root of your project.

This means that our api is now setup in our computer, but what about the remote server?
All we need to do, to set this up is run the following command from our terminal:

```shell
$ amplify push
```

This command will go ahead and provision the remote server for us. 
The whole process should take roughly 15 minutes, so you have plenty of time for a coffee. â˜•â˜•â˜•

To verify that the CLI is set up correctly, run the following command:

```shell
$ amplify status
```

If all went well, the Amplify CLI should output the following status table with no resources listed:

```shell
| Category | Resource Name         | Operation  | Provider Plugin   |
| ---------| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------   |

| Auth     | mygreatappac234765    | No Change  | awscloudformation |

| Api      | mygreatapp            | No Change  | awscloudformation |

```
Under the operation column, you should be able to see that there is no changes.
That means that we have successfully provisioned our remote server 
and our local and remote environments are in sync!

The Auth column means we can use an Amazon Cognito User Pool to act as the backend 
that users will be able to sign up and sign in. If you want to read more on this, 
have a look at the â€˜Authenticationâ€™ steps from the [AWS Amplify Authentication guide](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication).

### Testing our API

Once we've verified our resources have been created, 
weâ€™re ready to create the app & begin interacting with the API.
Apart from testing our API through the [AppSync dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/home), we can test it locally as well!

All we need to do is run the following command and a local AppSync mock endpoint will start up:

```shell
$ amplify mock
```

The terminal will output a link to an instance of the GraphiQL IDE, 
where you can see the GraphQL docs on any field or type and test your queries and mutations.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have now successfully provisioned the remote servers and hopefully were able 
to test all your resources locally using the GraphiQL IDE.

Stay tuned for the next part of this series that will take you through integrating AWS into your React app.
