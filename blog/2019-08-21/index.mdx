In this post we will learn how to install how to query data from the AppSync API using React Hooks.

### Apollo Client

Apollo client is a great tool that helps us build client 
applications using a GraphQL API. We will be interacting with AppSync using React Apollo Hooks.

We are going to be using a simple example for learning purposes. 
We can use the a simple Todo App to demonstarte how Apollo Hooks work, 
but before we do anything we have to set this up.

Firstly we need to install our dependencies.

```shell
$ yarn add apollo-react-hooks || npm install apollo-react-hooks --save
```

Now we need to wrap App.js with the Apollo Hooks Provider.

```js
// src/App.js
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react';
// Add the following lines to your App.js imports
import { Rehydrated } from 'aws-appsync-react';
import { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo';
import { ApolloProvider as ApolloHooksProvider} from 'react-apollo-hooks';
import ListTodos from './ListTodos'
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import config from 'aws-exports';

Amplify.configure(config);

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
        <ListTodos />
    </div>
  );
}

const WithProviders = () => (
  <ApolloProvider client={client}>
    <ApolloHooksProvider client={client}>
      <Rehydrated>
        <App />
      <Rehydrated />
    <ApolloHooksProvider />
  <ApolloProvider />
);

export default withAuthenticator(WithProviders, true);

```

#### Queries

As you can see in the `App.js` file there is a new import apart from the Apollo Hooks.
This is the `ListTodos` component, which is responsible 
for querying and listing our list of todos.

```js
import React from "react";
import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { useQuery } from "react-apollo-hooks";
import Todo from "./Todo";

const LIST_TODOS = gql`
  query LIST_TODOS {
    listTodos {
      items {
        id
        name
        description
      }
    }
  }
`;

const ListTodos = () => {

  const { data, error, loading } = useQuery(LIST_TODOS);

  if (error) return "Error!"; // You probably want to do more here!

  if (loading) return "loading..."; // You can also show a spinner here.

  return (

    <ul>
      {listTodos &&
        listTodos.items.map(todo => {
          return (
            <Todo 
              key={todo.id} 
              name={todo.name} 
              desc={todo.description}
            />
          );
        })}
    </ul>
    
  );
};

export default ListTodos;

```

And that's all it takes to query data from our AppSync API using Apollo Hooks!
